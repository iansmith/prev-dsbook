This is the best book about Datastar.  This is trivially true
since, at the time of writing, it's the only book about datastar.  

Datastar is the javascript library (15KB!) to end all javascript
libraries.  This book will show you how to use Datastar to
write a simple program, the ubiquitous __Todo List__ app.  We'll work through 
both the theory and practice of Datastar as we build
the Todo List in [go (aka golang)](https://go.dev). 

Oh, and there won't be any javascript.  Datastar is the javascript library 
(15KB!) to end all javascript
libraries.
